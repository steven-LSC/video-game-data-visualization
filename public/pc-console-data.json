    "description": "100 years before the main events of the game, the Calamity Ganon returned, controlled the Guardiens and indirectly killed the legendary four Champions as well the King of Hyrule. Link was also badly wounded, while protecting Princess Zelda from Guardiens, and put into the Shrine of Life by Zelda. After an 100 year sleep, Links awoke with no memories of what happened 100 years ago. Shortly after that the spirit of the King of Hyrule tells Link what happened before and during his sleep. He must then go to the people, the 4 Champions belonged to, and into the four Titans, great divine beasts which was controlled by the Champions. There in order to free the spirit of the Champions (Mipha, Daruk, Revali and Urbosa) he must defeat the corresponding 4 blights, that killed the 4 Champions long ago. There he also learns more about the Champions and what relationship Link had with them. In the end he needs to go to Castle Hyrule to Battle Calamity Ganon and to rescue Zelda, who stayed there all the years, to keep Ganon's powers at bat..",

Koopa, Morton Koopa Jr., Roy Koopa, Iggy Koopa, Lemmy Koopa, Ludwig Von Koopa, and Larry Koopa. They have stolen seven wands from the seven kings of seven worlds: Grass Land, Desert Land, Water Land, Giant Land, Sky Land, Iced Land, and Pipe Maze. So Mario and Luigi are off to stop the Koopas. New features are at their aid: the simple touch of a leaf can transform Mario or Luigi into part-raccoon and it allows them to fly. If they obtain a raccoon suit, they can briefly turn into a statue, and more. The fate of the Mushroom Kingdom lies in the hands of the Mario Brothers. Can they defeat the seven Koopa kids and even King Koopa himself?",
